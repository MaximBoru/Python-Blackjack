# Python-Blackjack
Implementation of basic blackjack game using python
This game utilizes a single shuffled deck, rebuilt and reshuffled upon each play
For simplicity, aces are treated as 11s only instead of 1 or 11

To run, download all 3 python files and ensure that they are all in the same location/folder
Execute from the gui.py file, which creates a session.db sqlite file using db.py to hold game data
To change initial money value, modify the 5th variable on line 26 of db.py assuming gui.py has not been executed since downloading
If gui.py has been executed, the session.db file has been created and must be deleted if you wish to modify starting values

enjoy!
